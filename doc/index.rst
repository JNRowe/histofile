``histofile`` is a small tool to aid in the management of ``NEWS`` files for
a project.

The intention is that each time you commit or merge a change that warrants an
entry in your ``NEWS`` file you also add a new ``histofile`` data file.  When it
is time to cut a new release you tell ``histofile``, and it updates your
``NEWS`` file from your pre-existing entries.

This *should* save an enormous amount of time, as it reduces the need to scan
through the commit log then manually create a ``NEWS`` file.

The data files are stored as plaintext in your chosen directory with one file
per entry, which means unlike a developer updated ``NEWS`` file in your
repository ``histofile`` should work easily across merges [1]_.

It is written in moonscript_, and requires v0.3.0 or later.  ``histofile`` is
released under the `GPL v3`_.

.. [1] ``git``, and some other VCSes, do support per-file merge tools that can
   make a simple edited file approach work.  Using that may be the best option
   for you!
