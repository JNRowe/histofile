Contributing
============

Pull requests are most welcome, but I'd appreciate it if you could follow the
guidelines below to make it easier to integrate your changes.  These are
guidelines however, and as such can be broken if the need arises or you just
want to convince me that your style is better.

* Indentation is 4 spaces.
* luadoc_ syntax should be used for code documentation

.. _luadoc: http://luadoc.luaforge.net/
